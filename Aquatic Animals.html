		<h1>1. Whale sharks</h1>
		<p>
            Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the ocean, known to grow up to 18 metres long, weigh up to 19,000 kilograms and live for 70 to 130 years. Each whale shark has unique polka-dot markings on its body, similar to a human fingerprint.
            They have mouths that are nearly a metre wide, with more than 350 rows of teeth, but these gentle giants feed mainly on plankton, using their mouths as a filtration system.
            As of 2016, these beautiful creatures have been classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with an alarming reduction in sightings.
            Their disappearance is largely due to commercial fishing and illegal poaching, with demand from China for their meat, fins and oil sold for food, and their skin for bags.
        
        </p>
        <h2>location</h2>	
        <p>
            Whale sharks thrive in warm, tropical seas, and have been known to migrate all over the world, from the Americas to Asia, to Africa and Australia.
		One of the best places to see these creatures is Ningaloo Reef on the western coast of Australia. Whale sharks migrate every year from March to June to feed on the abundance of plankton in the area.
		You can also visit the Maldives to encounter the year-round population of whale sharks. Head to the South Ari Atoll or the famed Hanifaru Bay from September to December for the best chance of spotting whale sharks, due to the build-up of plankton in the wet season.

        <h1>2. Sea otter</h1>
        <p>
            The gorgeous sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammals on earth, and they play a crucial role in our ecosystem, feeding on sea urchins which allows kelp forests to thrive. They’re an incredible species, boasting an impressive string of skills.
	Sea otters can live their entire life without leaving the water; they are one of the few species on earth that use tools to survive (they use rocks to hammer shells open); they are the only marine mammal that can flip boulders over on the sea floor; 
	they consume between 25 to 40% of their body weight every day; and they adorably hold hands while they sleep, to keep from drifting apart.
	They also have the densest fur of any creature on earth, with around 1 million hairs per square inch. Unfortunately, their beautiful fur is also their biggest threat, due to rampant hunting by humans for sea otter pelts.
	Their populations once numbered over several hundred thousand, however their numbers plummeted to less than 2,000 due to the fur trade. Since the international ban on large-scale commercial hunting in 1911, numbers have increased to just over 100,000.
	Sadly, the sea otter is still classified as endangered by the IUCN, due to other threats such as pollution, oil spills and entanglement in fishing equipment.

        </p>
        <h2>Loctaion</h2>
        <p>
            California in the US is the best place to find sea otters in the wild. Prime sea otter spotting locations include Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, Pacific Grove, Point Lobos State Reserve, Fisherman’s Wharf and Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve.
            You can spot them all year round, but January and February are the best months to see the mothers floating with their baby otters on the stomachs, as pups are usually born between November and March.

        <h1>3. Galapagos Penguin</h1>
        <p>
            As the only penguin species found north of the equator and in the Galapagos Islands, this penguin is quite unique.
            It’s the smallest of the South American penguin species, and generally survive for 15 to 20 years in the wild. They are one of the few animals in the world that mate with one partner for life.
            The Galapagos penguin is an endangered species, with less than 2,000 left in the wild. Their numbers are severely declining due to warming sea temperatures and declining food sources, brought on by El Nino Southern Oscillations (an irregular variation in winds and sea surface temperatures).
            They are also threatened by introduced species such as dogs and cats, pollution and bycatch in fishing equipment.
            The Galapagos fur seal is another fascinating marine species that’s endemic to the Galapagos Islands. With a declining population of around 10,000 to 15,000, the fur seal is also classified as endangered by the IUCN.
        
        </p>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
            The Galapagos penguin and fur seal can only be found in the Galapagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador. The best time to visit these enchanting islands is during the warmer, wetter season of December to June, with pleasant temperatures and good underwater visibility.
	From February to May, you can see penguins, seals, sea lions, turtles and tortoises breeding among a blanket of spring flowers, and witness the blue-footed boobies performing their fascinating courtship dance.
	You can also visit during the colder, dry season of June to November, where an abundance of plankton arrives, providing penguins with food and a show for underwater divers.

        <h1>4. Dumbo Octopus</h1>
        <p>
            Dumbo octopuses live in the deep open ocean down to depths of at least 13,100 feet (4000 m) and perhaps much deeper, making this group the deepest living of all known octopuses. Life at these extreme depths requires the ability to live in very cold water and in the complete absence of sunlight.
	 Dumbo octopuses are naturally rare, and the deep sea is enormous, so these species have specialized behaviours to increase the likelihood that they can successfully reproduce anytime that they find a mate. Females apparently always carry eggs in different stages of development, and they can store sperm for long periods

	 fter mating with a male. Using these advantages, female dumbo octopuses can transfer sperm to their most developed eggs any time the environmental conditions are right for reproducing. Though they spend much of their lives suspended above the seafloor, dumbo octopuses lay their eggs on the bottom, attached to rocks or other hard surfaces.
	Dumbo octopuses move by slowly flapping their ear-like fins, and they use their arms to steer. They are foraging predators and eat pelagic invertebrates that swim above the sea floor. As there are few large predators in the deep sea, dumbo octopuses’ primary predators are diving
	 fishes and marine mammals, including tunas, sharks, and dolphins. Due to their preference for extreme depths, they are only very rarely captured in fishing nets and are probably not threatened by human activities.

        </p>
        <h2> Location</h2>
        <p>Since they are one of the deepest living octopuses—found at depths of 400-4,800 meters below the ocean surface—they do not need the ink sac as a defines mechanism. Although they are believed to be found worldwide, they have only been observed around New Zealand, Australia, California, the Philippines and New Guinea

        <h1>5. Vampire Squid</h1>
        <p>
            Vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernal is) are cephalopods that inhabit oceanic depths between 2,000 and 4,000 feet. They have reddish-brown skin and large, saucer-shaped blue eyes. Unlike most squids,
            vampire squids lack defensive ink sacs. Instead, these squids expand their arms and web in a defensive posture and use the photophores (light emitting organs) on the tip of their arms and fins to confuse predators while they make a quick escape.
        </p>
        <h2>Loctaion</h2>
        <p>
            Vampire squid are found in temperate and tropical deep-water zones worldwide at depths of 600 to 1200 m (1958 to 3937 ft).
	 The water temperature at those depths is very cold, 2-6o C (35.6 to 42.8 o F). This is the OML (oxygen minimal layer) where there may be less than 5 per cent oxygen saturation and little or no light.
	 Most cephalopods cannot go below 50 per cent oxygen saturation
